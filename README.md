Finance Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (FinMTEB), a counterpart to MTEB that consists of financial domain-specific text datasets. In summary, FinMTEB consists of a total of 64 datasets, spanning seven different tasks. The key difference between MTEB and FinMTEB is that all datasets in FinMTEB are finance-domain specific, either previously used in financial NLP research or newly developed by the authors.
